ðŸŸ¦ Use rules.yml when:
The user asks a single, specific question, and you want the bot to respond directly with a simple one-line answer.

There is no follow-up expected in the conversation.

Example:
User: "What is pH?"
Bot: "pH is the measure of acidity or alkalinity of water."

âœ… Use rules.yml for:

pH

TDS

Hardness

Contamination
â€¦any static, fact-based response.



ðŸŸ¦ Use stories.yml when:
You want to handle a multi-turn conversation where the user might continue asking follow-up questions.

The response needs to change depending on context or what the user said earlier.

Example:
User: "What is pH?"
Bot: "pH is the measure of acidity..."
User: "Can you show me a chart?"
Bot: "Sure! Hereâ€™s the link..."

âœ… Use stories.yml when:

The user might ask for more information after the initial reply.

You want the chatbot to handle conversations that have more than one step.

In short:

Use rules = for direct Q&A.

Use stories = for conversations.
