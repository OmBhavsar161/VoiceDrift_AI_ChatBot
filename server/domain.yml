  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hii! Welcome to the VoiceDrift AI Chatbot!<br />I am Delta, your AI-powered Virtual Assistant. How can I assist you today?<br />You can ask me about water levels, hydrogeological scenarios, water quality, available reports, NOC conditions, NOC Guidance, Ground Water terms, Ground Water Report."


  utter_goodbye:
    - text: "Goodbye! Have a nice day."

  utter_water_level:
    - text: "The water level scenario depends on the aquifer type, recharge rates, and extraction patterns. For specific data, please refer to the latest groundwater assessment report for your area."

  utter_hydrogeological_scenario:
    - text: "The hydrogeological scenario includes information about aquifer properties, groundwater flow, and recharge mechanisms. Detailed studies are required for accurate assessment."

  utter_water_quality:
    - text: "Water quality is assessed based on parameters like pH, TDS, hardness, and contamination levels. Regular monitoring is essential to ensure safe water usage."

  utter_available_reports:
    - text: "Available reports include Groundwater Resource Assessment Reports, Water Quality Reports, and Hydrogeological Studies. Contact your local groundwater authority for access."

        Comprehensive Groundwater Report:<br />
        1. Groundwater Resource Assessment: Includes recharge rates, extraction data, and sustainability analysis.<br />
        2. Categorization of the Area: Classified as Safe, Semi-Critical, Critical, or Over-Exploited based on groundwater usage.<br />
        3. Groundwater Management Practices: Recommendations for rainwater harvesting, artificial recharge, and sustainable extraction.<br />
        4. NOC Conditions: Conditions for obtaining NOC include permissible extraction limits, purpose of use, and compliance with regulations.<br />
        5. How to Obtain NOC: Submit an application to the groundwater authority with required documents like site details, extraction purpose, and hydrogeological report.<br />
        6. Groundwater Terms: Definitions of terms like Aquifer, Recharge, Water Table, and Piezometric Surface.<br />
        7. Training Opportunities: Workshops and courses on groundwater management are offered by institutions like CGWB and NIH.

  utter_noc_conditions:
    - text: "Conditions for obtaining NOC include permissible extraction limits, purpose of use (domestic/industrial/agricultural), and compliance with groundwater regulations."
    # <br />Would you like to receive a PDF of these conditions?"
  

  utter_noc_guidance:
    - text: "To obtain NOC, submit an application to the groundwater authority with required documents like site details, extraction purpose, and hydrogeological report."
    # <br />Would you like to receive a PDF of these guidance details?"

  utter_groundwater_terms:
    - text: |
        Groundwater Terms:<br />
        1. Aquifer: A body of permeable rock that can contain or transmit groundwater.<br />
        2. Recharge: The process by which water enters an aquifer.<br />
        3. Water Table: The upper surface of the zone of saturation.<br />
        4. Piezometric Surface: The level to which water will rise in a well.

  utter_training_opportunities:
    - text: "Training opportunities include workshops and courses offered by institutions like the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and National Institute of Hydrology (NIH)."
